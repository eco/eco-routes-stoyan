/**
 * @file index.ts
 *
 * Main entry point for the eco-routes semantic-release plugin.
 * Exports all lifecycle hooks that this plugin implements.
 *
 * Semantic Release Lifecycle Order:
 * 1. verifyConditions - validate environment and versions
 * 2. analyzeCommits - determine next version (built-in to semantic-release)
 * 3. verifyRelease - additional verification (optional, not implemented here)
 * 4. generateNotes - create release notes (built-in to semantic-release)
 * 5. version - update version information in Solidity files and package.json
 * 6. prepare - build, deploy contracts using deterministic addresses, verify contracts
 * 7. publish - publish the packaged library to npm
 *
 * This plugin enables automated versioning, contract deployment, and publishing
 * as part of a continuous delivery pipeline for the Eco Routes protocol.
